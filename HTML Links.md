## CSS

Chapter15 

Block-level elements start on a new line.

Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.

Controlling the Position of Elements

**CSS** has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:

**Normal flow** Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. 

**Relative Positioning** This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the op, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
  
**Absolute positioning** This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow

**Chapter 3** “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse 
 the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements.

To create a Function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

**FUNCTION DECLARATION:**- A function declaration creates a function that you can ca ll later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book.

**Calling Function:** you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line code, 
when you call a function that has parameters,
you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. 

**VARIABLE SCOPE** The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code.
If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function.
