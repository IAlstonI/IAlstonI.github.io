Chapter 6: “Tables”
A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
Basic Table Structure
**<table>** used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
**<tr>** indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag, At the end of the row you use a closing </tr>.
**<td>** represente Each cell of a table.
**<th>**used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.
The **colspan** attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.
The **rowspan** attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
The **headings** of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.
The **body** should sit inside the <tbody> element.
The **footer** belongs inside the <tfoot> element.
