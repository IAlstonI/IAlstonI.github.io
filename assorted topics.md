# Chapter 16: “Images”
Where the <img> elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class attribute :

small
medium
large
**Aligning images Using CSS** :

The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

**Centering images Using CSS** :

By default, images are inline elements.
On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

**Background Images background-image** :

p {background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}
repeat : The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the background repeat property isn't used).
repeat-x The image is repeated horizontally only
repeat-y The image is repeated vertically only.
no-repeat The image is only shown once.
fixed The background image stays in the same position on the page.
scroll The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

# Chapter 19: “Practical Information”

**Brainstorm** List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.
**Organize** Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.
**Research** There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider.
**Compare** It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics
where there is a lot of competition.
**Refine** Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.
**Map** Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.
